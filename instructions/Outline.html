<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>
  In this study you will play with another participant. 
  You will be forming a "bowling team" and each of you will have to make the decision whether you want to take the lead and bowl for your team.
  There are good bowlers who score more often and bad bowlers who score less often. 
  You will not know whether you are the good bowler or the bad bowler but you will receive some information from a trial run. 
  Everything in more detail below.  
</p>

<p>
  You and your partner will bowl in the trial run.
  Think of this game as bowling but with a blindfold. 
  When you bowl you can either score a strike or miss.
  Good players are more likely to score a strike than bad players.
</p>

<p>
  When bowling you wear a blindfold so you will not know whether you scored a strike or not. 
  First both you and your partner will play a trial round. 
  After the trial round you will receive some information.
</p>

<h4>Guess</h4>

<p>
  We will then ask you to guess how likely it is that you and your partner are good players.
  For each question you may earn a prize of {{ beliefs_payoff }} as an additional bonus payment.
</p>

<h4>Game</h4>

<p>
  Afterwards, you and your partner will have to make a decision. 
  One of you has to play for the team.
  If the player who plays for the team scores a strike, both players may earn a prize of {{ decision_payoff }} as an additional bonus payment.
</p>

<h4>Survey</h4>
<p>After the experiment there will be a short survey.</p>

<h4>Payments</h4>
<p>
  For the completion of this study you will earn {{ completion_payoff }}. 
  Additionally, we will randomly pay your team either for the Guess or the Game.  
</p>

<h4>Matching</h4>
<p>
  We will match you with a partner after this page. 
  You may have to wait for a partner to arrive.
  If a partner does not arrive within {{ max_wait_time }} minutes, a computer player will take over as your partner.
  The computer player will make decisions in order to maximize its earnings. 
  We will let you know when a computer player takes over as your partner. 
</p>

<p>
  If your partner drops out during the game we will replace him or her with a computer player.
  Note that this happens very rarely.
