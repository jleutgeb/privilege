<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>
  In this study you will play with another participant. 
  All participants can be of either Type A or Type B. 
  There is a 50/50 chance that a participant is Type A or Type B.
  <b>You are Type A.</b>
</p>


<p>
  You will be forming a "bowling team" and each of you will have to make the decision whether you want to take the lead and bowl for your team.
  There are good bowlers who score more often and bad bowlers who score less often. 
  You will not know whether you are the good bowler or the bad bowler but you will receive some information from a trial run. 
  Some players who score in the trial will receive a star that is for all to be observed. 
  Everything in more detail below.  
</p>

<p>
  You and your partner will bowl by clicking a button in the trial run.
  Think of this game as bowling but with a blindfold. 
  When you bowl you can either score a strike or miss.
  Good players are more likely to score a strike than bad players.
</p>
<p>
  You will not know for sure if you or your partner are good players or not, and neither will your partner.
  <ul>
    <li>Good players have a chance of {{ qH }}% of scoring a strike. </li>
    <li>Bad players have a chance of {{ qL }}% of scoring a strike. </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The probability of being a good player is different for Type A and Type B players.
  <ul>
    <li>Type A players have a chance of {{ phi_i }}% to be a good player.</li>
    <li>Type B players have a chance of {{ phi_j }}% to be a good player.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  When bowling you wear a blindfold so you will not know whether you scored a strike or not. 
  First both you and your partner will play a trial round. 
  After the trial round you will receive some information.
  You and your partner may either receive a star ★ or a circle ● next to your Player ID.
</p>

<p>
If a Type A player scores a strike:
  <ul>
    <li>{{ pk_i }}% chance of receiving ★</li>
    <li>{{ pn_i }}% chance of receiving ●</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  If a Type B player scores a strike:
  <ul>
    <li>{{ pk_j }}% chance of receiving ★</li>
    <li>{{ pn_j }}% chance of receiving ●</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  If a player does not score a strike he or she will always receive ●.
</p>

<p>
  By observing the stars and circles you can learn how likely it is that you are a good player or your partner is a good player.
</p>

<h4>Guess</h4>

<p>
  We will then ask you to guess how likely it is that you and your partner are good players.
  For each question you may earn a prize of {{ beliefs_payoff }} as an additional bonus payment.
  The probability of winning the prize depends on your guess and whether the you and your partner are good players.
  We will show you the exact probabilities when you make the choice.
</p>

<h4>Game</h4>

<p>
  Afterwards, you and your partner will have to make a decision. 
  One of you has to play for the team.
  If the player who plays for the team scores a strike, both players may earn a prize of {{ decision_payoff }} as an additional bonus payment.
  If this player does not score a strike, both players do not earn this prize.
  Both you and your partner decide whether you want to play for the team.
  If only one player wants to play, this player is chosen to play for the team.
  If either both players or none of the players want to play, one player is randomly chosen to play.
</p>

<h4>Survey</h4>
<p>After the experiment there will be a short survey.</p>

<h4>Payments</h4>
<p>
  For the completion of this study you will earn {{ completion_payoff }}. 
  Additionally, we will randomly pay your team either for the Guess or the Game.  
</p>

<h4>Matching</h4>
<p>
  We will match you with a partner after this page. 
  You may have to wait for a partner to arrive.
  If a partner does not arrive within {{ max_wait_time }} minutes, a computer player will take over as your partner.
  The computer player will make decisions in order to maximize its earnings. 
  We will let you know when a computer player takes over as your partner. 
</p>

<p>
  If your partner drops out during the game we will replace him or her with a computer player.
  Note that this happens very rarely.
