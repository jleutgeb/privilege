<p>The Berlin Social Science Center (Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, WZB), Reichpietschufer 50,
    10785 Berlin is conducting a scientific online experiment today. You have been recruited for this experiment
    because you have registered in the recruitment system on our website. The experimental procedures will be explained
    to you before the start of the experiment.</p>

<p>During the experiment you will face a number of different tasks and your responses will be recorded by our
    computer system. The data recorded in the experiment do not allow any inference about the participation or
    the decisions or responses of individual who participate in the experiment. Correspondingly, the analysis
    and presentation of all results of this experiment will be anonymized. The anonymous research data will be
    archived and will possibly be made available to other scientists for further use.</p>

<p>The data generated in the experiment will not be linked to the data in the recruitment system. The data collected
    for the payment of compensation (e-mail address or bank details) will always be stored separately from the
    experimental data. Participation in today‘s experiment is of course entirely voluntary. There will be no
    disadvantages for you if you decide not to participate. You have the possibility to exit an experiment at any
    time.</p>

<p>We want to ask for your consent to participate in the experiment and to the implied processing of data. You can
    revoke your consent at any time with an effect for the future, for example, by sending an e-mail to
    experimente@wzb.eu. Your consent is at the same time the legal basis for the processing of data.</p>

<p>For any further information about the processing of your data and data protection, especially about your rights to
    disclosure, correction, deletion, limitations of processing of data, objection, data transmission and complaints
    to a supervisory body, please contact the data protection officer of WZB: datenschutz@wzb.eu.</p>

<p>You cannot participate in today‘s experiment without consenting. If you do not wish to consent, please talk to the
    experimenter. Thank you.</p>

    processing of data:</p>
