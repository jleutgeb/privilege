<h4>Welcome</h4>

<h4>Urn Draws</h4>

<p>
  In this experiment you will go blind bowling cousin
</p>

<p>
  You will interact with another participant in this experiment. We will refer to this person as your partner.
</p>

<h4>Decision 1</h4>

<p>
  You will bowl but not earn any money.
</p>

<h4>Information and Guesses</h4>

<p>
  Afterwards, you will receive some information. We will show you kudos. 
</p>

<p>
  We will summarize all the information that you have received in a table like the one below.
  If you have not received information, the elements will be colored grey and have a question mark.
  After you have received information, the elements will be updated with the corresponding color.
</p>

<p>
  After you have received the information we will ask you to evaluate how likely some statements are.
  For each statement there is a prize of {{ beliefs_payoff }}
  The probability of winning the prize depends on your guess and whether the statement is true.
  To maximize the probability of earning the prize you should simply guess how likely each statement is true on average.
  We will show you the exact probabilities when you make the choice.
</p>

<h4>Decision 2</h4>

<p>
  You will bowl again and you have to decide whether you want to lead.

</p>

<p>If you decide not to choose from your own doors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your partner will choose a door from their doors.</li>
    <li>If your bowls well, both you and your partner will each receive {{ decision_payoff }}.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Survey</h4>
<p>After the experiment there will be a short survey.</p>

<h4>Completion</h4>

<p>
  At the end of the experiment you are free to wait or return to Prolific. For completion you will earn {{ completion_payoff }}.
