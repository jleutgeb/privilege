<p>
    You are the first-mover. You again have ... doors to choose from.
    Your partner also has ... doors to choose from.
</p>

<p>
    The number of winning doors among your doors depends on the ball that we drew for you in the beginning of the experiment.
    The number of winning doors among your partner's doors depends on the ball that we drew for them in the beginning of the experiment.
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the ball drawn from Urn 1 is blue, ... of the doors are winning doors.</li>
        <li>If the ball drawn from Urn 1 is red, ... of the doors are winning doors.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The doors have been shuffled and the winning doors may be in different places than the first time.
    You now have to decide whether to choose from your own doors or to choose the same door that your partner chooses from their doors.</p>

<p>If you decide to choose from your own doors:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your partner will decide whether to choose the same door as you or to choose one of their doors.</li>
    <li>If you choose a winning door, you will receive ....</li>
    <li>Your partner's earnings then depend on their choice:
        <ul>
            <li>If your partner decides to follow your door choice and you choose a winning door,
                they will also receive ....</li>
            <li>If your partner decides not to follow your door choice, they will choose from their own doors.
                Your partner will then only receive ... if they choose a winning door.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you decide not to choose from your own doors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your partner will choose a door from their doors.</li>
    <li>If your partner chooses a winning door, both you and your partner will each receive ....</li>
</ul>
