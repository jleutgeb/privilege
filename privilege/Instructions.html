<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>
  In this study you will play with another participant. 
  All participants can be of either Type A or Type B. 
  <b>You are Type A</b> and your partner is type B.
</p>

<p>
  One of you is better at bowling but you do not know who. 
  The better player has a {{ qH }}% chance of scoring a strike, while the other player has only a {{ qL }}% chance of scoring a strike. 
  The probability of being the better player is different for Type A and Type B players.
  Type A players have a {{ phi_i }}% chance of being the better player, so type B players have a {{ phi_j }}% chance of being the better player.
</p>

<p>
  When bowling you wear a blindfold so you will not know whether you scored a strike or not. 
  First both you and your partner will play a trial round. 
  After the trial round you will receive a message. 
</p>

<p>
  There are two possible messages. You can either get positive feedback, or no feedback. 
  <ul>
    <li>ðŸ’¯ ðŸ¤© You/Your partner scored a strike! ðŸ¤©</li>
    <li>No feedback on your/yourpartner's performance</li>
  </ul>
</p>

{{ if player.privilege }}

<p>
  If you score a strike, you have a {{ pk_i }}% chance of receiving positive feedback. Else, you will receive no feedback.
</p>

<p>
  If your partner scores a strike, they have a {{ pk_j }}% chance of receiving positive feedback. Else, they will receive no feedback.
</p>

{{ else }}

<p>
  If you score a strike, you have a {{ pk_j }}% chance of receiving positive feedback. Else, you will receive no feedback.
</p>

<p>
  If your partner scores a strike, they have a {{ pk_i }}% chance of receiving positive feedback. Else, they will receive no feedback.
</p>

{{ endif }}

<p>
  By observing the feedback you can learn who is the more likely to be the better player.
</p>

<h4>Guess</h4>

<p>
  We will then ask you to guess how likely it is that you are the better player.
  You may earn a prize of {{ beliefs_payoff }} as an additional bonus payment.
  To maximize the probability of earning the bonus payment, you should state your best guess.
</p>

<h4>Game</h4>

<p>
  Afterwards, you and your partner will have to make a decision. 
  One of you has to play for the entire team.
  If the player who plays for the team scores a strike, both players may earn a prize of {{ decision_payoff }} as an additional bonus payment.
  If this player does not score a strike, both players do not earn this prize.
  Both you and your partner decide whether you want to play for the team.
  If only one player wants to play, this player is chosen to play for the team.
  If either both players or none of the players want to play, one player is randomly chosen to play.
</p>

<h4>Survey</h4>
<p>After the experiment there will be a short survey.</p>

<h4>Payments</h4>
<p>
  For the completion of this study you will earn {{ completion_payoff }}. 
  Additionally, we will randomly pay you and your partner either for the Guess or the Game.  
</p>

<h4>Matching</h4>
<p>
  We will match you with a partner after this page. 
  You may have to wait for a partner to arrive.
  If a partner does not arrive within {{ max_wait_time }} minutes, a computer player will take over as your partner.
  The computer player will make decisions in order to maximize its earnings. 
  We will let you know when a computer player takes over as your partner. 
</p>

<p>
  If your partner drops out during the game we will replace him or her with a computer player.
  Note that this happens very rarely.
